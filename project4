Project 4

FILL.asm
Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input. 
When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen,
i.e. writes "black" in every pixel. When no key is pressed, 
the screen should be cleared.

MULT.asm
Multiplies R0 and R1 and stores the result in R2.
(R0, R1, R2 refer to RAM[0], RAM[1], and RAM[2], respectively.)
The algorithm is based on repetitive addition.
